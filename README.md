# Context in React

This repository contains the code for the context in React tutorial.

The repository contains two branches for each example of context in React:

- One branch contains the code for the tutorial without using context. This code implements the same functionality as the tutorial but with props drilling.
- The other branch contains the code for the tutorial using context.

Two examples are covered in the tutorial at the moment:

- [x] Theme Context: This example demonstrates how to use context to change the theme of a React application.
- [x] Internationalization Context: This example demonstrates how to use context to change the language of a React application.
